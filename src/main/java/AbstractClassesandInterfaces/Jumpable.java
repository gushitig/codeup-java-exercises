    //there are mainly 3 reasons to use interfaces:
    //used to achieve abstraction
    //by interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance
    //it can be used to achieve loose coupling
        //coupling when building a java program, try to have everything be independent of each other ex you want a screw driver to just be that not also a hammer, bc that way you know exactly what each file does, so if theres a problem you know exactly where to go to look or fix it
    //this is why object oriented programming is so powerful - there are entire ibraries of things/tools people have already crated ad you have access to that


    //contract that outlines specific behaviours
    //anything that can fly is gonna have fly but might not necessarily fly the same way (ex bird, plane, butterfly)
